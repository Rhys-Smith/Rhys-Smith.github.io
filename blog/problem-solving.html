   <h1> Problem Solving </h1>
   <br>
    <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem </h2>
        
            <p>
                
                      
                    Being me, I over think alot and small problems are no different. Something simple as a 
                    <br> missing bracket or semicolon can fail code and im one to over look these problems.
                    <br>
                    <br> Utilizing the Rubber ducky method, reviewing my code, reading error messages
                    <br> console.logging and googling are ways that help me understand what im doing wrong 
                    <br> a good 95% of the time. Pseudocode is a great way to keep track of what you need 
                    <br> to do as well as leaving yourself notes if your forgetful.
                    <br>
                    <br> Throughout the process I just felt confused, very, very confused which is great for 
                    <br> me atleast. Its like a drive to learn and your constatnly thinking about it and 
                    <br> engaging with the problem. Eventually I find what the problem is or its pointed out.
                    <br> For me, Being engaged with these problems and actively trying to solve a problem on
                    <br> my own helps immensely with learning or memorizing proper problem solving skills.   
                    <br>
                    <br> I think its fair to say that im still learning not only these activities in sprint 4 
                    <br> but from 3 as well. Ive definitely picked up the concept on alot over the past weeks 
                    <br> but theres so much information to retain and commands that this will be an endless 
                    <br> journey of learning for all of us.        
                
            </p>

                    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
                        <p>  
                             Using Pseudocode to leave comments or instructions on where you left of or what you still 
                        <br> need to do. Plain and simple.
                        </p>             
                    <br> 

                    <h2>Trying something</h2>
                        <p>  
                             Theres no harm in trying something you've reflected on or found on google. Figuring out what 
                        <br> works and what doesnt work is better then not trying to solve the problem at all.     
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
                        <p>   
                              Talk to something or yourself and think about what you're saying. Chances are you can figure 
                        <br>  what it is you're overlooking. If not, you can always revise your code and compare it to code
                        <br>  that works and see what you've missed. 
                        <br>  Most of the time its something simple like a bracket or semicolon ived missed.
                              
   
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
                        <p>   
                              Reading error messages is Extreamly helpful to finding out whats wrong with your code. 
                        <br>  Could be a misplaced bracket or simply that varible has already been declared.
                        <br>  Saying that, finding whats wrong with your code is important to make it functional and
                        <br>  reading your error messages is a great way of doing so.      
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Console.logging</h2>
                        <p>   
                              If your code is failling you can console.log it you see what the cause of the error is.
                        <br>  Also you console.log to check the outcome of your code.  
                            
                        </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Googling</h2>
                        <p>   
                            Use good google seaches to find a solution to what you're stuck on. 
                            
                        </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Asking coaches or your peers for help</h2>
                        <p>  Theres no shame in asking anyone for help, Were all going to struggle with material no matter what.
                        <br>[1] Try and use some of the problem solving techniques/processes.    
                        <br>[2] Look in slack if people have struggled with the same problems and read through what helped them.
                        <br>[3] Ask your facilitator for help, theyre here to help you through what ever your stuck on.
                        <br>    Or ask one of your peers for help.
                        <br>  In turn if your peers cant help or facilitator is busy or offline you could just move on and come 
                        <br>  back to the material later on.
                        </p>
