   <h1> BootCamp Plan </h1>


   <h2>
    What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
</h2>

        <p>
            My goal would be to work in tech, web development is very enjoyable, pursing a career 
    <br>    in web development is something ive looked forward too and enjoy alot. 
        </p>

    <br>


<h2>
    What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
</h2>

        <p>
          Ive certainly learned alot more through the sprints but to be quite honest, Its pretty 
    <br>  hard to remember all of that for me atleast.
        </p>

    <br>


<h2>
    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h2>

        <p>
          Definetly staying on top of material, im not the best at it and that might cause issues
    <br>  in bootcamp but i dont know.
        </p>

    <br>


 <h2>
    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
</h2>

        <p>
          teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback,  
    <br>  developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.
    <br>  Improve on all of these really is all i have to say, Im not one to be a leader of such 
    <br>  but working well with team memebers would be the most important.
        </p>

    <br>


<h2>
    What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
</h2>

        <p>
          I dont expect anything from anyone other then to treat everyone around them equal.
    <br>  Support for me mainly comes from my friend, always confident in what i can do and boosts 
    <br>  my mood when im down so i'ld say its really great for me. 
        </p>

    <br>


<h2>
    What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
</h2>

        <p>
          I manage my work load by trying to get a minimum amount down perday, 
    <br>  depending on how big the work load is so i can even it out throught 
    <br>  the week and not dump a whole lot on myself at once and get overwhelmed.
    <br>
    <br>  I ask for help after ived looked for answers on slack or google, reviewed 
    <br>  material from  past sprints. I dont like to relie on people around me if I 
    <br>  havent properly tried to understand. 
        </p>

        <h2>strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
       <p>A big limitation for me is my a.d.d, sometimes I cant focus at all and sometimes i hyper focus, its never
        <br> consistent. 
           <br> Im easy to work with   </p>
    
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
         <p>Social skills, im not the best at speaking to people i just meet.</p>
        
    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>
        <p>I will manage my time to make sure i complete things in a time ive set for myself. </p>
   
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2> 
            <p>I normally re read my code first before using google to solve my problem or revise on 
                <br> content we already learnt, if that doesnt work I ask my facilitator </p> 
        
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h2>
        <p>I dont have any conflicting commitments with this course.</p>
