   <h1> My Learning Plan </h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My goal would be to work in tech, web development is very enjoyable, pursing a career in web development is something ive looked forward too and enjoy alot. </p>
    
        <h2>strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
       <p>A big limitation for me is my a.d.d, sometimes I cant focus at all and sometimes i hyper focus, its never
        <br> consistent. 
           <br> Im easy to work with   </p>
    
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
         <p>Social skills, im not the best at speaking to people i just meet.</p>
        
    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>
        <p>I will manage my time to make sure i complete things in a time ive set for myself. </p>
   
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2> 
            <p>I normally re read my code first before using google to solve my problem or revise on 
                <br> content we already learnt, if that doesnt work I ask my facilitator </p> 
        
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h2>
        <p>I dont have any conflicting commitments with this course.</p>
