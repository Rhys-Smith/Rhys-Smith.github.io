         <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        
           <li> How to deal with my frustration is a big one, instead of quiting or getting  
             <br> angry over something I instead look at what im doing wrong and try 
             <br> something else. Putting all that thought into thinking not quiting.
             <br> What we've learnt in core honestly has helped me understand things 
             <br> like how to keep calm, think Clearer and approach problems.

           <br>

             <br> For my ego, I honestly dont know, I feel as if i dont hold an ego with myself 
             <br> like this. What we've learnt in core honestly has helped me understand things 
             <br> like how to keep calm, think Clearer and approach problems.

           <br>

             <br> Over all  
             <br> I feel like I can handle that little bit more then I could previously.
             <br> Our journey has just begain and theres so much to learn still and I feel 
             <br> ready to try.  

           </li>

           <br>

           <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        
           <li> Being able to recognize how other people see you or how you see yourself can affect   
             <br> how you think about different things. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses,
             <br> Being aware of how people feel and operate helps alot when getting to know or 
             <br> helping a person with something they struggle with. 
             <br> Expressing and openly sharing your weaknesses and strengths with those around you
             <br> helps not only you but everyone around you understand what you personally struggle 
             <br> with and how we can help.  
             <br> 
           </li>

           <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        
           <li> Mainly explained in the first question.</li>

           <br>

           <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        
           <li> Understanding myself really, My thought processes, How I process information,    
             <br> My ethics on problem solving. It can become difficult to understand at times 
             <br> but over this whole learning experience, ive learnt how to deal with alot 
             <br> of the problems I use to get stuck or struggled with. 
           </li>

           <br>

           <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        
           <li> I think learning core is important to not only understand how to code     
             <br> but to understand ourselfs and what we are capable of doing.  
             <br> Two things I found most important that I learnt from core was  wellbeing 
             <br> and learning practices, These two practices have helped me alot throughout 
             <br> this course, wellbeing being the most important part to me.
           </li>

           <br>

           <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
            
           <li> No, Not at all and I find it very important as its helped me understand what
             <br> I struggle with mentally and ive been able to really deal with my a,d,d as 
             <br> a result thanks to core learning. Im more relaxed and I feel better about  
             <br> myself when I dont understand something or im struggling to understand.
             <br> I find myself feeling alright about it all when I never use to and thats
             <br> been so valuable to me.
