 <h1> Javascript Fundamentals </h1>
 <br>
     <h2>The differences between HTML and CSS.</h2>
        <p> HTML, Its simple,bland and bare, showing the bare bones of coding on a webpage. HTML plants the initial building blocks on your webpage.
           <br> CSS, Behind styling is CSS. CSS takes the bare webpage, adds styling and structure to your webpage, leaving you with your desired look. 
        <img class="example" src="img/scales.png">
           <br>  Both are equally as important as eachother, Creating a stable relationship  </p>
      <br>

     <h2>control flow and loops.</h2>
        <p>Control flow is all about the direction and order in which your code gets executed. Like daily tasks, You can choose the order in which these task are completed.
           <br> Loops allow repetitive actions to continue one after another untill a specified point. Loop functions happen when specified, Like tying your shoes amoung other things.  </p>
        
      <br>

     <h2>The Dom.</h2>
        <p>The Dom is a programming interface for web documents, Structured like a tree starting with the document to html and then to the elements. 
           <br> The Dom represents the html as nodes and objects, Allowing the document to be modifed on the webpage
           <br> using JavaScript. Since the html document and javascript are synced, Every change you make using the Dom to manipulate elements from your webpage   
           <br>saved on both. </p>

     <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
        <p>Arrays and Objects both store values, they differ from each in the way they store values. 
           <br>Arrays are great for listing values, such as names, numbers, food etc. Arrays use square brackets to store values.
           <br> <img class="example" src="img/code.png">  
           <br>Objects allow data to be store with the value, giving key information about a peron,animal,price of something or generally anything you want to store.
           <br> <img class="example" src="img/code2.png">
           <br> This allows you to have detailed information about something listed in an order under the same variable.
        </p>
      <br>
     <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
     <p> Functions are a block of code made up of instructions or steps that output an action. 
       <br>This allows reusable code without having  to add more each time you want to repeat the process.
       <br>Functions help keep clean code and easy to find by cutting out repeating commands. which helps minimizing bugs, keeps code short and saves alot of time.
