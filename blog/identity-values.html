   <h1> Identity, Values and Strengths </h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
    <p>Born and lived in New Zealand all my life, I personally dont follow culture but i strive to always be polite
    <br>and respectful to other </p>
   
    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>A big value I like to hold is good relationships with people. Keeping everyone on good terms 
        <br> not only with myself but with each other is something I personally enjoy, I cant stand 
        being around negativity    <br>   </p>
        
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>Strengths for me would be a quite worker, I communicate when needed and a good friend.</p>
