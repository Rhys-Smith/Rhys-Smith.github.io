         <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
         <p>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
            Neuroplasticity allows
              <br>the brains to create conections or pathways of sorts and shapes them to a
                  particular activity or memory. 
              <br>Practicing activities, reviewing material or retrieving memories over and over in different ways 
                  builds more connections.
              <br>Recognising that learning is essential to growth, We can take different 
                  apporches to learning</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
         <p>Practice challenges and actitivies as I already do. 
              <br>Making sure I fully engage and commit in challenges set by Dev Academey also keeping that learning aspect up front.   </p> 
         <br>
         <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </h2>
         <p>Selecting activities that challenge you and commiting yourself to the activity.
              <br> Repetitive motion or repetition of activities.
